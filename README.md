## Project Overview
This repository highlights the process of integration testing for API controllers in an ASP.NET MVC application using the NUnit and xUnit testing frameworks.

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the creation of integration tests that verify the functionality of API controllers, ensuring they properly interact with the database (such as SQL Server managed through SSMS).

## Testing Frameworks
- NUnit: A mature and popular .NET testing framework.
- xUnit: A free and open-source testing framework known for its readability and ease of use.
  
## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of ASP.NET MVC, C#, and web APIs.
- Familiarity with NUnit or xUnit (choose one or both).
- Familiarity with SSMS(SQL Server Management Studio).
  
## Project Structure
- Controllers: Contains the code for API controllers, responsible for handling incoming requests, managing responses, and interacting with the data and application layers.
- Models: Includes data model classes that define the structure of entities like Event, User, and others.
- Properties: Stores configuration files, such as connection strings and environment-specific settings.
- Views: Contains UI elements like Razor views for the MVC framework.
- Tests: This section includes integration tests for the application, focusing on the "Eventmi" app.
